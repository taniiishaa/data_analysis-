üìå Task Summary
- This Google Colab notebook analyzes sales data from CSV files. The project was part of my internship tasks and demonstrates data cleaning, aggregation, visualization, and actionable insights.
- It goes beyond basic analysis by including correlation heatmaps, top-product analysis, and monthly sales trends.

üöÄ My Development Process
1. Project Planning & Breakdown
- Objective: Analyze sales data to identify top products, regions, and trends.
- Tools: Google Colab for interactive Python coding and visualization.
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- Plan included:
   a.Data exploration and cleaning
   b. Aggregation of sales by product and region
   c.Time-series analysis of monthly sales
   d.Correlation heatmaps
   e. Visualizations with insights

2. Core Implementation in Colab
- Uploaded CSV file to Colab and loaded it using Pandas.
- Explored the dataset: checked columns, shape, missing values, and statistics.
- Cleaned data by removing duplicates and filling missing values.
- Aggregated sales data by Product and Region.
- Created professional visualizations: bar charts, horizontal bar charts, line plots for monthly sales.
- Added correlation heatmap to understand numerical relationships.

3. Extra Touches for Professional Look
- Interactive charts with clear titles, axis labels, and colors.
- Markdown cells in Colab for writing observations and insights.
- Time-series analysis to track monthly sales trends.
- Correlation heatmap to highlight relationships between numerical features.

üìñ Application Description
- This Colab notebook allows users to:
   a. Explore and clean sales CSV files
   b. Summarize data by product and region
   c. Visualize trends and correlations
   d. Generate professional insights and observations

‚ú® Key Features
- Sales by Product: Identify top-selling products.
- Sales by Region: Compare regional performance.
